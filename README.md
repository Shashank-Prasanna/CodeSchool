# CodeSchool

Hello! This is the online Github repository for the CodeSchool Youtube channel. All my videos and code will be stored here. The videos will be stored in the appropriate lesson, along with the code for that lesson. Please subscribe to my channel, and press the bell for notfications from my channel! Have fun, and code on!

If you ever want to edit this repo, please edit it in the appropriate branch! If it's a good edit, I will approve the commit and add it to the master branch. Thanks!
